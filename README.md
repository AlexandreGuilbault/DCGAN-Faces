# DCGAN-Faces
Pytorch implementation of a DCGAN to generate faces from CelebA dataset

## Datasets

CelebA dataset from : https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset#img_align_celeba.zip is being used.

## Dependencies

Pytorch     0.4.1\
torchvision 0.2.1\
matplotlib  2.2.2\
numpy       1.15.1

## Outputs

Some examples of the generated images after 250 epochs of training.

## Issues

Catastrophic forgetting seemed to happen on a 64x64 bits image size with the full dataset. Reduced to 32x32 image size and a dataset of 30,000 images on the last version.
